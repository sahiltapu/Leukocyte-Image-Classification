This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying white blood cells (leukocytes) from microscopic images. This model can be a valuable tool for medical professionals in:

Automated Blood Cell Analysis: Assisting with faster and more accurate differential white blood cell (WBC) counts.
Research Applications: Supporting research on blood diseases and immune system function.
Educational Tools: Aiding in visualization and identification of different leukocyte types.
Features

Model Architecture: (Specify the architecture used, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT), or a custom architecture. Briefly describe its key features.)
Dataset: (Describe the dataset used for training, including its source, number of images, and the types of leukocytes it covers.)
Performance: (Report the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics on a held-out test set.)
Ease of Use: (Explain how to use the model, including dependencies, input format, and output format.)
Customization: (If applicable, mention the options for customizing the model, such as fine-tuning on specific datasets.)
Getting Started

Prerequisites:
    Python (version 3.10 or later)
    TensorFlow/PyTorch

Installation:
    Bash
        git clone https://github.com/sahiltapu/leukocyte-image-classification-using-CNN.git
        cd leukocyte-classification-model
        pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or your installation command
    Usage:
        Prepare your input images in the expected format (e.g., size, normalization).
        Run the script or function for classification:
        
Python
    python predict.py <image_path>
    Use code with caution.
    The script will output the predicted leukocyte type and additional information (confidence scores, probabilities, etc., if applicable).

Training (Optional)
    Our dataSet Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset
    Download or prepare your training data.
    Modify the training script according to your needs (e.g., hyperparameters, batch size, epochs).
    Run the training script.
